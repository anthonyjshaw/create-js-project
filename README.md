# Create Function and Test

Create a basic node project with jest installed.

## Instructions

First, install the package globally by copy and pasting the following into your terminal:

```npm i create-new-js-project -g```

Next, to create a new project, type the command:

```create-new-js-project <your-project-name>```

Make sure to replace ```<your-project-name>``` with the name of your project.

Finally, enter ```cd <your-project-name>``` and edit the files in your code editor of choice.

## Commands

```yarn test``` will run ```jest --watch```, allowing jest to track any updates to your test.
